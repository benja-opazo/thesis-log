## Introduction
It is important to clarify some terminology

>* **Voice**: The sound produced by vocal fold vibration (there is a broader term that includes all speech sounds)

>* **Vocalization**:  non-speech or pre-speech sounds produced by vocal fold vibrations

>* **PhonationÂ¨**: Technical term used to describe the physical and physiological processes of vocal fold vibration. It can be used with a prefix (e.g.: _dysphonic_ or _aphonic_)

## Chapter 2: 
Flow is defined as the volume of fluid passing given a cross section of the tube per second (m^3/s).

**This text will use U as airflow**

There are two kinds of pressure

>* **Absolute Pressure**: Measures the stress applied by fluid particles to adjacent particles (or the wall of the container) in reference to a **vacuum**. It is always **positive**

>* **Relative pressure**: Is measured in reference to atmospheric pressure or some other standard pressure. It can be positive or negative
